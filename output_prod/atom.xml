        <content type="html"><![CDATA[With the European elections in two weeks, it&#039;s astounding how little the campaigns talk about digital rights. Just two months ago, thousands of people took to the street to protest Article 13. They were backed up by 5 million signatures on an online petition. They stood up for digital rights, only for our representative politicians to keep quiet. If they won&#039;t talk about them, we can at least look at how they acted: by analysing their voting history. <a href="https://www.twentyoftime.com/2019/european-parliament-voting-digital-rights/">Read more »</a>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[From silently pushed legislation to serious public critiques, the history of technology legislation has seen it all. The EU prepares to take it one step further by wanting platforms to use unproven technology to protect economic interests. Article 13 of the new Copyright Directive is setting up for disappointment. <a href="https://www.twentyoftime.com/2019/unjust-technology-legislation-3/">Read more »</a>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In the second part of this series, we take a look at technology legislation after 9/11 and the American response. All but one of the laws discussed were drafted before the full scope of US surveillance became known. Even so, the public began to speak up. Starting in the European Union, public action soon spread to the rest of the world. Before we knew it, there were massive worldwide protests. <a href="https://www.twentyoftime.com/2019/unjust-technology-legislation-2/">Read more »</a>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[You are innocent until proven guilty, or until you decide to go online. The internet used to be a haven of free expression. Now it’s a place where every individual is suspected of being a terrorist or a pirate. Governments are caught up in an arms race of mass surveillance and hardly anyone appears to stop and think about the direction we’re heading in. It’s time to take a critical look at the technology legislation that undermines the core principles of a free society. <a href="https://www.twentyoftime.com/2018/unjust-technology-legislation-1/">Read more »</a>]]></content>
