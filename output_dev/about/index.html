<p>My name is Friso van Dijk and that’s what I do here on Twenty of Time. I use the knowledge from my PhD research and professional experience to investigate the concepts underpinning our use of information technology.</p>

<p>The topics I write about and how I present them are coloured by my personal views. They include the personal ownership of data, a focus on privacy and a general regard for human rights. With this lens I look at the use of information technology, (ab)use of personal data and relevant legislation.</p>

<p>My arguments are supported by compelling evidence. I’m aware that different views exist and present them when relevant, but may not do them the justice others feel they deserve. Both supporting and opposing views are welcome in the comments and I’d love to engage in respectful discussion. Alternatively you can contact me directly through the form below.</p>

<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>

<p>Taking a moment to think about the use of information technology often leads me back to invasions on basic human rights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copyright law threatens the <em>right to fair trial</em>, because if you’re accused you have to prove your innocence to a biased arbiter.</li>
<li>Storing information for an eternity can lead to the <em>retroactive criminalisation of acts</em>.</li>
<li>Corporate and government use of technology invade on the <em>right to privacy</em> in numerous ways.</li>
<li>Content filters and arbitrary rulemaking by technology platforms threaten the <em>right to expression</em>.</li>
<li>Social credit systems such as in China threaten the <em>right of association</em>.</li>
<li>(Unknowingly) biased algorithms break the <em>prohibition on discrimination</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are not small issues. But technology is not something neutral, it can also be used for good. I write about both the negative and positive impact on human rights with the use of information technology.</p>

<p>I also present practical insights in protecting your privacy and other rights. And investigate and explain how information technology and data processing work. A selection of my writing includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.twentyoftime.com/surveillance-the-uncomfortable-business-model-of-the-internet" target="blank">The uncomfortable business model of the internet</a>
<br/>An investigating of the shady online data market where surveillance capitalism rules.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.twentyoftime.com/password-cracking-requirements" target="blank">Password cracking and arbitrary requirements</a>
<br/>Asking myself how difficult it is to break a password. I learned what’s more important than a number and a special character.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.twentyoftime.com/dead-european-cookie-law" target="blank">Dead at conception: the European Cookie Law</a>
<br/>Those annoying cookie banners don’t seem to serve any purpose. A dive into the law that made them required exposes its flaws.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.twentyoftime.com/behind-the-screens-malware-analysis" target="blank">Behind-the-screens of malware analysis</a>
<br/>I interviewed a ransomware expert. He guided me through the process of breaking malware with cool anecdotes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-friso">About Friso</h2>

<p>Ever since my youth I’ve had a strong sense of justice. During my studies I found this particularly so in the (ab)use of technology. It all started with privacy awareness, which I turned into personal action. The more I learned, the more I saw the other injustices supported by technology.</p>

<p>Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I decided to create a space to share my knowledge and thoughts. I use what I know and find in my personal and professional research to explore the relation between technology and society.</p>

<p>Alongside my interest in technology, I’m enjoying life in The Netherlands together with my fiancée. As a fellow human, I enjoy all the commonalities such as food, music and (selectively) other humans. I love to read just about anything, from Russian literary classics to science-fiction to the label on the chocolate paste. Thinking about the complexity of the supply chain required for that chocolaty goodness is astounding.</p>

<p>Part of what I enjoy about having a blog is the entire creative process. Designing and building it to be an awesome reading experience. Telling stories and enriching them with illustrations. It’s as much a creative outlet as it is about sharing what I know and learn.</p>

<h2 id="collaborate-with-me">Collaborate with me</h2>

<p>I frequently get contacted for collaboration projects and I’d love to do more of them. Whether it’s an interview, a case study or a look at your product, feel free to discuss them with me.</p>

<p>For those who got inspired by what I wrote, Twenty of Time is open to publications by guest authors. This includes those with opinions different from mine. The only requirements are relevance, quality and verifiability of claims. Share your idea and I’ll get back to you with my thoughts.</p>

<p>I would also love it if you’re an artist and want to work together on one of my posts. People have many different views about how to express something as abstract as technology. It’s amazing how distinct and relatable so many of these are. If you’re reading this and feel inspired to create something for Twenty of Time, you know where to find me.</p>

<h2 id="housekeeping-announcements">Housekeeping announcements</h2>

<p>I share my personal views through my articles. This may spark a discussion, one in which everyone is welcome to participate. In return, I would request you to be respectful of others and their opinions. Fierce discussion is allowed, but I will not hesitate to act on rude and disrespectful behaviour.</p>

You are free to use it with clearly displayed attribution. Proper attribution is either a link to the homepage, the about page or the page the image came from. This is not a link to the image itself. I retain full rights to the textual content (aside from fair use of course) on this blog, but you can always message me with ideas for the creative ideas and translations.</p>

<p>If you decide to make creative use of any of my material, I'd love to know about it and share it. Let me know if you want more resources than those provided through the website (illustrator or SVG files, website source code) and I’ll see what I can do.</p>
